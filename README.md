# selenium-robot-testing
Getting the hang and having fun with selenium and robotframework to test browser applications.

By building several testsuits for sites like https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login, http://practice.automationtesting.in/ and a school group project the main directory here was to get to know the basics of automated testing. It took me a little while to get used to the python-syntax, coming for Java. Nevertheless I feel tempted to take a deep dive and look forward to try out pure Selenium with Java just to see what the possibilities are, in free time.
